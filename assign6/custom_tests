# File: custom_tests
# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.
# Each custom test is given on a single line using format:
#
#     executable  arg(s)
#
# The executable is the name of the program to run.
# The args are optional. If given, they are treated as a sequence of space-separated
# command-line arguments with which to invoke the executable program.
#
# For each custom test, sanity check will invoke your executable program and the
# solution program (using same command-line arguments), compare the two
# outputs to verify if they match, and report the outcome.
#
# Blank lines and comment lines beginning with # are ignored.
#
# Below is an example custom test, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.

# Make a VMRegion with 3 pages with pre-existing data, read all of them, and write all of them,  with 3 physical pages

# Create a VMRegion with 2 pages, read both, sweep the second one, and that second one should then be a candidate for removal
test_harness mytest/check_sweep.txt
# sweep the second page in VMRegion1, and check if the requested page in VMRegion2 can kick that out
