# master_repo .gitignore 
# mchang & jzelenski tweaked Feb 2017
#
# Ignore patterns should likely start with / to anchor to the top-level
# dir. If you don't anchor, a pattern like *.o will ignore matching files
# in subdirs, which can lead to problems.
# Having accidentally ignored files in starter is no good -- they will
# not be detected, can get propagated to student repos and then tracked into
# mercurial, ugh.
# Having accidentally ignored files in grade/samples is undesirable but
# not that serious. 
# We often have symlinks in grade/samples to build products/executables
# in top-level. Tracking the symlink isn't of much value, but better than
# ignoring it altogether.

# no track compiled python, no anchor, match anywhere
*.pyc

# these files come and go, should not be tracked
/grade*/soln_output

# don't track these build products, anchored to top-level dir
/*.d
/*.o
/*.a
/*_soln

# explicitly name project executables here, anchored to top-level dir
/crash
/movielookup
/movie-test
/destruct

# starter is auto-generated
/starter
