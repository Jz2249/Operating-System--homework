# File: custom_tests
# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.
# Each custom test is given on a single line using format:
#
#     executable  arg(s)
#
# The executable is the name of the program to run.
# The args are optional. If given, they are treated as a sequence of space-separated
# command-line arguments with which to invoke the executable program.
#
# For each custom test, sanity check will invoke your executable program and the
# solution program (using same command-line arguments), compare the two
# outputs to verify if they match, and report the outcome.
#
# Blank lines and comment lines beginning with # are ignored.
#
# Below is an example custom test, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.

stsh < samples/scripts/one-command.txt
# single command test
echo "ls -a" | $stsh
sleep 1 | $stsh
# two process pipeline test, check if child run in parallel
stsh < sleep 1 | sleep 1
# read 12345 from pipe
stsh < test/two_process2.txt
# more two process tests in file
stsh < test/two_process.txt

# Multi-Process Pipelines, check if each child process can communicate within the pipeline
stsh < test/multi_process1.txt
# should sleep 3 second
stsh < sleep 3 | sleep 3 | sleep 3
# more multi-process tests with more than 3 child in file
stsh < test/multi_process.txt

# test I/O direction, if the input file is invalid, (e.g.  ss.txt < invalid.txt)
stsh < test/IOtest.txt
# I/O direction test with read and write with pipe
stsh < test/IOtest2.txt
stsh < test/IOtest3.txt
stsh < test/IOtest4.txt
# check if we have multiple segmentation fault
stsh < test/seg_test.txt
