----------------------
1)  Thread 1 could be doing some parts of leave_eastbound while thread 2 could be doing some parts of arrive_eastbounds, but this isn't possible in the original implementation.

2)  Two threads may increment crossing_eastbound and crossing_westbound at the same time. If thread 1 is notified to cross westbound and is going to lock westlock, but
    thread 2 starts to run arrive_eastbounds function which lock the westlock first, then a race condition will happen after thread 2 unlock the westlock because both cross bound values
    will be incremented.
3)  Engineers didn't test for certain situation. For example, they didn't test whether the user can edit the command and the machine can function correctly
    after they typed wrong command in some situations.   

4)  Engineers can do various tests including boundery test, unit test and etc to make sure machine perform correctly in each situation.
